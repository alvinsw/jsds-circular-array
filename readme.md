# JavaScript Data Structure Library: CircularArray
This is a JavaScript implementation of circular buffer (or cyclic buffer, or ring buffer) data structure. 
It is implemented using a single, fixed-size built-in array as if it were connected end-to-end.
It provides a bounded storage well suited for keeping a list of the most recent N objects.
